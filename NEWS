2.0.2:

* add new methods
  - OCI8#select_one(sql, *bindvars)  -> first_row

  - OCI8#ping   -> true or false

    Verifies that the Oracle connection is alive.
    OCI8#ping also can be used to flush all the pending OCI
    client-side calls to the server if any exist.

  - OCI8#client_identifier = client_id

    Look at the following link to know what is the client identifier.
      http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-solutions/oracle-session-tracing-part-i-16356

    Note that the specified identifier doesn't change the v$session
    immediately. It is done by the next network round trip
    such as OCI8#exec or OCI8#ping.

  converted to OCI8.encoding, not by String#size.

  ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9.1.
