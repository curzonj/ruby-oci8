How to run unit test

  before runing unit test, 
  1. connect to Oracle as system:

      $ sqlplus system/<password_of_system>

  2. create user ruby:

      SQL> CREATE USER ruby IDENTIFIED BY oci8;

     or

      SQL> CREATE USER ruby IDENTIFIED BY oci8
         2 DEFAULT TABLESPACE users TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp;

  3. grant the privilege to connect and execute.

      SQL> GRANT connect, resource TO ruby;

  4. If the Oracle version is 8i or later:

      SQL> CREATE TABLE ruby.test_clob (filename VARCHAR2(40), content CLOB);

  5. connect to Oracle as sys

      $ sqlplus 'sys/<password_of_sys> as sysdba'

  6. grant the privilege for the unittest of blocking-mode.

      SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON dbms_lock TO ruby;

  7. change test/config.rb as you like

  Then you can run:
    $ make check
  or
    $ nmake check   (If your compiler is MS Visual C++.)
